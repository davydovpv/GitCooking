## Overview

Learn how to cook for yourself and save money by developing a comprehensive recipe regimine. You first log your diet for a week to determine what foods you regularly spend too much money on. After that, the app finds similar recipes that help you learn how to make your own meals. Share your new cooking expertise with your friends by sending them recipe recommendations and pictures of your food. A great way to learn tasty, useful recipes, save money, and interact with your friends.

## Rationale

A struggle for many college students is finding healthy cheap food. Many students spend a great deal of time at food courts and dining halls where they end up spending lots of money on food that is not very nutritious. While cooking at home is a healthier, cheaper alternative, it is often viewed by students as difficult and time consuming. For this reason we decided to design an app that attempts to encourage users to step into the kitchen and spare their wallets. 

The first part of our solution is demonstrating to our users how much money they can save by preparing their own food at home. By asking our users to create a log of what food they eat, and how much they spent on it, it becomes easy to show them through a direct price comparison how much they can actually save. 

There are many other recipe apps on the market. However, these are often recipe aggregators, that can easily overwhelm users with choices. By providing a selection of recipes that are guaranteed to be simple to prepare and require easy to obtain ingredients, we make a promise to our users that they will be able to make the recipes they find on our app.
